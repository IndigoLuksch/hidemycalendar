        <h1>How Security Works</h1>
        
        <p>
            1. A calendar subscription link is input <br>
            2. Using a secret key stored in Cloudflare's Secretes Store, the original URL is encrypted. A new, private URL of format <code>.../?url=<encrypted_url></code> is generated. The original URL is not stored <br>
            3. When a calendar application requests event information from the private URL, a Cloudflare worker decreypts the encrypted URL, fetches event details, modifies them to show only as 'Busy', and passes this on to the calendar application.
            <br><br>
            Key security features:<br>
            • the original URL is not stored by Cloudflare <br>
            • event details are not stored by Cloudflare <br>
            • the original URL is present in the private URL in encrypted form <br> 
            <br><br>
