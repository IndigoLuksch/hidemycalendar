        <h1>How Security Works</h1>
        
        </ol>
            <li>A calendar subscription link is input </li>
            <li>Using a secret key stored in Cloudflare's Secretes Store, the original URL is encrypted. A new, private URL of format <code>.../?url=<encrypted_url></code> is generated. The original URL is not stored </li>
            <li>When a calendar application requests event information from the private URL, a Cloudflare worker decreypts the encrypted URL, fetches event details, modifies them to show only as 'Busy', and passes this on to the calendar application.</li>
        </ol>
        
            <h3>Key security features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>the original URL is not stored by Cloudflare </li>
            <li>event details are not stored by Cloudflare </li>
            <li>the original URL is present in the private URL in encrypted form </li>
        </ul>
