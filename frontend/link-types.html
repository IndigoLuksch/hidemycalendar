        <p>
            Links ending with <code>.ical</code> are static: they contain information about events in the calendar when it is shared, but will not update when new events are added. 
            <br> 
            Links beginning with <code>webcal</code> are dynamic: when the calendar which is being shared is updated, subscribers will see the new events.
